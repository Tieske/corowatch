corowatch
=========

Lua module to watch coroutine usage and kill a coroutine if it fails to yield in a timely manner. The main purpose is preventing code from locking the Lua state.
As a convenience function coroutine.wrapf() is included which allows any function to be watched, not only coroutines.

Implementation notes
====================

1. To protect access to coroutines, the module must override the existing coroutine functions. Besides overriding the `create()`, `wrap()`, `status()`, `yield()`, and `resume()` functions, it adds additional functions `watch()`, `wrapf()` and `gettime()` to the global `coroutine` table. 
1. Additionally the global `debug.sethook()` is modified to prevent a coroutine from removing it's own 'watch' routine (from the paranoia department).
1. __Important__: The default `gettime()` function loads LuaSocket to use the `socket.gettime()` function. If you do not use LuaSocket, then it might be better to replace `coroutine.gettime()` with a more lightweight implementation.

Usage
=====
Usage is fairly simple, call the `watch()` method on a coroutine to protect it and provide the timeouts and callbacks as required.

Example (see the `./examples` folder):

```lua
require("corowatch")

local f = function()
  local callcount = 0
  while true do
    -- something for a coroutine to do here
    callcount = callcount + 1
  end
end
local kill_timeout = 1   -- seconds
local warn_timeout = 0.8 -- seconds
local warncount = 0
local cb = function(cbtype)
  if cbtype == "kill" then 
    print("now killing coroutine...")
  elseif cbtype == "warn" then 
    warncount = warncount + 1
    print("Warning, coroutine might get killed...." .. warncount)
    if warncount < 4 then
      return true   -- reset the timeouts
    end
  end
end

print(coroutine.resume(coroutine.watch(coroutine.create(f), kill_timeout, warn_timeout, cb)))
````

When run the example code returns the following results;
````
Warning, coroutine might get killed....1
Warning, coroutine might get killed....2
Warning, coroutine might get killed....3
now killing coroutine...
false	Coroutine exceeded its allowed running time of 1 seconds, without yielding
````
